<strong>PLAY MARIO IN YOUR BROWSER</strong><br>
You can control Mario by using the arrow keys and spacebar to jump or crouch. Crouching on a pipe will warp you to fall from above the screen. Jumping below certain brick blocks, will break them. 

<strong>DEVELOPER GOAL</strong><br>
The idea behind this project was to Create a playable Mario in the browser by only using a combination of HTML and Javascript. There are a number of physics and game libraries out there that I could've used but decided not to for the pure enjoyment of doing it myself.

<strong>THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.</strong><br>
There are a number of obvious bugs that need to be fixed. This is mostly due to the collision detection and physics needing to be refined.
