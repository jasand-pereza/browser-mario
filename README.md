=============

#### Play Mario in Your Browser
You can control Mario by using the arrow keys and spacebar to jump or crouch. Crouching on a pipe will warp you to fall from above the screen. Jumping below certain brick blocks, will break them. 

#### Developer Goal
The idea behind this project was to create a playable Mario in the browser by only using a combination of HTML and Javascript. There are a number of physics and game libraries out there that I could've used but decided not to for the pure enjoyment of doing it myself.

#### This Is Still a Work in Progress.
There are a number of obvious bugs that need to be fixed. This is mostly due to the collision detection and physics needing to be refined.

#### Demo
To see a demo, go to [http://www.jasandpereza.com/labs/browser-mario](http://www.jasandpereza.com/labs/browser-mario)

#### Requirements
Please use Chrome. It hasn't been tested in other browsers.

#### Basic Install
From anywhere on your computer, open the index.html file in your browser. Follow the on screen instructions on how to control Mario.

#### Advanced Installation (more options)
For other options such as the level creator, put this folder on a web server that can run PHP.
  Using the Level Creator: type in the path of **[path to files]/browser-mario/create-level.php**
  
#### Future Development
 Since this was an experiment, it may or may not continue to be developed. Feel free to use the code or even the concept to develop this further.
