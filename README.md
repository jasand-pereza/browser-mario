<strong>PLAY MARIO IN YOUR BROWSER</strong>
You can control Mario by using the arrow keys and spacebar to jump or crouch. Crouching on a pipe will warp you to fall from above the screen. Jumping below certain brick blocks, will break them. 

DEVELOPER GOAL
The idea behind this project was to Create a playable Mario in the browser by only using a combination of HTML and Javascript. There are a number of physics and game libraries out there that I could've used but decided not to for the pure enjoyment of doing it myself.

THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.
There are a number of obvious bugs that need to be fixed. This is mostly due to the collision detection and physics needing to be refined.

REQUIREMENTS
Please use Chrome. It hasn't been tested in other browsers.

BASIC INSTALLATION
From anywhere on your computer, open the index.html file in your browser. Follow the on screen instructions on how to control Mario.

ADVANCED INSTALLATION (more options)
For other options such as the level creator, put this folder on a web server that can run PHP.
  Using the Level Creator: type in the path of [path to files]/browser-mario/create-level.php
  
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
 Since this was experiment, it may or may not continue to be developed. Feel free to use the code or even the concept to develop this further.
